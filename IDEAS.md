# Project Ideas & Feature Requests

This document is the intake hopper for new feature requests, brainstormed concepts, and future improvements.

Ideas can be added directly by the repository owner, during interactive brainstorming sessions, or conceived during Senior PM Meta-Improvement sprints.

---

## Status Legend
- `[IDEA]`: Raw concept or proposal; needs refinement.
- `[VETTED]`: Architecture and trade-offs verified against [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) and [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
- `[SCHEDULED]`: Formalized into atomic tasks and added to [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- `[REJECTED]`: Decided against (rationale recorded).

## Letter-Grading Rubric
Every idea in this hopper or proposed during agent briefings must be assigned an explicit letter grade:
- **Rank A+**: Unambiguously high leverage, zero architectural regression, solves an immediate friction point or delivers huge capability. **Mandatory immediate promotion to ROADMAP.md**.
- **Rank A / A-**: High value, well-aligned, requires planned milestone scheduling.
- **Rank B+ / B**: Nice-to-have optimization or polish item.
- **Rank C / D**: Marginal value, excessive maintenance overhead, or misaligned with core manifesto.

### [STATUS] Feature Name (Rank <GRADE>)
- **Summary**: Brief description of the capability.
- **Rationale**: Why this is valuable for the user or system.
- **Constraints & Alignment**: Trade-offs, dependencies, performance implications.
- **Proposed Phase**: Target phase in ROADMAP.md.
- **Suggested Tasks**:
  - [ ] Atomic task breakdown

## Active Ideas & Brainstorming Hopper


### [VETTED] Sovereign Zero-Dependency Static Analysis & Linter Guard (Rank A+)
- **Summary**: Lightweight AST syntax and hygiene checker (`tools/linter.py`).
- **Rationale**: Instant verification in <0.04s catching syntax breaks before test execution.
- **Status**: Implemented in Run 005 via ADR-004.

### [VETTED] Universal Machine-Readable JSON Telemetry Pipeline (Rank A+)
- **Summary**: Comprehensive `--json` output across all subcommands (`radar`, `loops`, `health`, `dashboard`).
- **Rationale**: Enables autonomous agents and external tooling to consume telemetry programmatically.
- **Status**: Implemented in Run 010 via ADR-005.
